# Experimental AcoustID backend in Go

[![build status](https://code.oxygene.sk/acoustid/go-acoustid/badges/master/build.svg)](https://code.oxygene.sk/acoustid/go-acoustid/commits/master)

The goal of this project is to reimplement all AcoustID backend components in Go and
make them easier to use outside of AcoustID itself.
